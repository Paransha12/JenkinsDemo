Create API in Node.JS:

For creating API we need node.js software. Node js will download npm packages also, but we need to install and activate express.js services.

Express: It is framework for building and creating web applications and APIs, also it is a free and open source which works on backend of Node.js.


___________________
Install Visual Studio Code for writing your source code:

For writing source code we will be using JSON file.

->Create a folder in VScode.
->Create a JSON File and give the details.
(NOTE:JSON file will never start with square brackets[])
-> Save the file.

Now create a server file in which we will provide Port and the connectivity details along with the EndPoint of the API.

Host: localhost
PortNo: 8080

The body of Server.JS file will be divided into three parts:
Rest api
Endpoint
Connecion and listen port detail

REST API: will require express fraework.
Define it:
var express = require('express'); // requre the express framework
var app = express();
var fs = require('fs'); //require file system object
__X_________
ENDPOINT:here getUser is a method which will call func req and res.

// Endpoint to Get a list of users
app.get('/getUser', function(req, res){
    fs.readFile(__dirname + "/" + "user.json", 'utf8', function(err, data){
        console.log(data);
        res.end(data); // you can also use res.send()
    });
})
_____________X_________
CONNECTION:
// Create a server to listen at port 8080
var server = app.listen(8080, function(){
    var host = server.address().address
    var port = server.address().port
    console.log("REST API demo app listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)
})

______________________
Now,
In terminal start your server and type:
npm instal express --save     \\ it will install express framework
Node Sever.js    \\ will run the file

Open chrome give url: http://localhost:8080/getUser      \\endpoint which is listening at 8080
